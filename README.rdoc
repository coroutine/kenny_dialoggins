== Kenny Dialoggins

Hey, I'm Kenny Dialoggins, here's why I'm here:

<b>Freakin' Dialogs</b>:  You want a sweet dialog in your Rails app, but you don't want to mess with Javascript.

== Usage

Before you go installing Kenny Dialoggins, you need to know a few things about me:

* I don't work alone.  I need my kick-ass backup singers, Prototype and Scriptaculous.
* Because Microsoft sang a little flat on IE8, I got disoriented and couldn't figure out where I needed to stand on stage (absolute positioning is f'ed.) So, if you want me to stand in the right place, you'll want to use Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera or IE 6/7.

=== Installation

    script/plugin install git@github.com:coroutine/kenny_dialoggins.git
    
    script/generate kenny_dialoggins_assets # This'll put a .js file in public/javascripts and a .css file in public/stylesheets

== Examples

If you want my dialog in your app, here's what you need to do:

    # Create the dialog
    <%= render_dialog :danger_zone_dialog, :partial => "danger_zone" %>
    
    # Invoke the dialog
    <%= link_to_function "Highway to the...", show_dialog(:danger_zone_dialog) %>
    
That's pretty much it.  You like that.  I can tell.  Don't Fight it.

So, here's the skinny.  <tt>render_dialog</tt> always needs a unique id for its first argument.  After that, it will
take the same options as <tt>ActionController::Base#render</tt>.  It'll also take a few more; those being:

* <tt>:before_show</tt> - a Javascript function that will be invoked before the dialog is shown
* <tt>:after_show</tt> - a Javascript function that will be invoked after the dialog has become visible
* <tt>:before_hide</tt> - a Javascript function that will be invoked before the dialog is hidden
* <tt>:after_hide</tt> - a Javascript function that will be invoked after the dialog has been hidden

So, here's an example using before show:

    # Create the dialog, with a callback
    <%= render_dialog :footloose_dialog, :partial => "footloose", :before_show => "function() { alert('Everybody get footloose!') }" %>
    
    

Yours Truly,
Kenny Dialoggins
